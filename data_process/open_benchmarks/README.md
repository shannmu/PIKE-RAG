# Dataset Protocol

## Pipeline and Script Description

Assume that you are in the directory `data_process/`:

```sh
python main.py config/datasets.yaml
```

## QA Protocol Overview

We defined a general QA data protocol as below:

```py
qa: Dict = {
    # str: The unique qa id generated with uuid.uuid4().hex.
    "id": "a unique qa id",

    # str: The question to be answered.
    "question": "the question to be answered",

    # List[str]: A list of correct answers, could be a list of single value for some datasets.
    "answer_labels": ["a list of correct answers", "there could be only one answer for some datasets"],

    # Literal["yes_no", "undefined"]: may be extended in the future.
    #   "yes_no" indicates the answer should be in ["yes", "no"].
    "question_type": "undefined",

    # Dict[str, Union[str, List]]: The set of metadata information, varied among different datasets.
